		<p>A wise woman once told me something that I'll never forget: "Everything is like soup."</p>
  	<p>Mhmm.. Take that in for a minute or thirty. How simple yet profound... Everything is like freakin soup...</p>
		<p>Here are some examples:</p>
  	<h5> 
			<ul>
				<li>"Ugh, finals week blow!" Yes, you know what else blows? You. When your soup is too hot. Ok, it doesn't work so well here but lets try another example..</li>
		
				<li>"Jee whiz Stacy, you have such a calm and soothing personality." You know what else has a calm and soothing personality? Clam chowder. So, you can tell Stacy that she's just like clam chowder. "Aww, thank you, you're too sweet!" Stacy would reply.. Then guess what else is sweet, mushroom soup.</li>
			</ul>
		</h5>
  <p>Every <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/poop?pronunciation&amp;lang=en_us&amp;dir=p&amp;file=poop0001" title="poop" target="_blank">poop</a> you've ever taken is like soup, she said. Sometimes its runey and other times it's chunky. Sometimes it's red like a tomato bisque soup &#40;yum&#33;&#41; and if you're healthy, then it's like a hearty beef chunk chili soup.</p>
